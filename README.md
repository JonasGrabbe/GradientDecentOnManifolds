Stochastic gradient descent on Riemannian manifolds
Silvere Bonnabel
Stochastic gradient descent is a simple approach to find the local minima of a cost function whose evaluations are corrupted by noise. In this paper, we develop a procedure extending stochastic gradient descent algorithms to the case where the function is defined on a Riemannian manifold. We prove that, as in the Euclidian case, the gradient descent algorithm converges to a critical point of the cost function. The algorithm has numerous potential applications, and is illustrated here by four examples. In particular a novel gossip algorithm on the set of covariance matrices is derived and tested numerically.

QEC: In this paper, Silvere Bonnabel presents a stochastic gradient descent algorithm on a Riemannian manifold, proving that like with its Euclidian counterpart, it will converge to a critical point of the cost function.

Key insights and lessons learned from this paper include the development of a new gossip algorithm on the set of covariance matrices, and four examples are given of the potential applications of this stochastic gradient descent algorithm.

The 10 most important keywords used in this paper are Stochastic Gradient Descent, Riemannian Manifold, Cost Function, Euclidian Space, Gossip Algorithm, Covariance Matrix, Critical Point, Convergence, Noise, and Application.

The ideas in the paper come from optimization and control theory, as well as machine learning.
Opposite to these ideas lies a more traditional gradient descent algorithm which relies on Euclidean space rather than a Riemannian manifold.
These ideas could lead to further research into optimizations on non-Euclidian manifolds, as well as other application of stochastic gradient descent.
Similar ideas to this paper include research into optimization on non-standard spaces and more robust algorithms for noisy cost functions.
Questions to ask the authors:

How could this algorithm be used in practical applications?
Are there any other algorithms which are as efficient as the stochastic gradient descent algorithm on a Riemannian manifold?
Are there any potential issues which arise from the application of this algorithm?
How does one parameterize a Riemannian manifold for use with this algorithm?
Is there a trade-off between the convergence rate and accuracy of the algorithm?
Suggestions for related topics or future research directions include further research into gossip algorithms, optimization on non-standard spaces, and applications of stochastic gradient descent on a Riemannian manifold. Relevant References:

Q1 : What are the four illutrated examples in the paper explain them in detail for a beginner in the field.
Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: Model-based reinforcement learning is the use of a model to approximately create a “simulation” of a real-world environment. This approach can be used to learn behaviors without directly discovering them through data. The model is used to simulate a reward system, similar to how a reward is received in the real world, thereby providing the agent with feedback on which it can base its subsequent choices.

Evolutionary Algorithms: Evolutionary algorithms are a family of heuristic search algorithms that use principles of evolution, such as mutation and selection, to search a solution space. These algorithms are characterized by their use of stochastic optimization techniques, such as genetic crossover, mutation, and selection. The goal of these algorithms is to find a solution which meets some desired fitness criteria, within a specified valid search space.

Model- Free Reinforcement Learning: Model-free reinforcement learning is the use of a direct approach to learning behaviors from experience. This approach does not require building a model of the environment before learning behaviors. Instead, the goal is to directly infer behaviors from experience, where the agent interacts with the environment and learns through trial and error.

Deep Reinforcement Learning: Deep reinforcement learning uses deep neural networks to learn from high-dimensional observation input. The agent learns through a series of trial and error interactions with the environment. By using deep neural networks to process the states of the environment, the agent can learn policies and value functions which map out optimal pathways in a much more efficient manner.

Q2 : Compare gradient descent on Euclidean space vs Riemannian manifold. Explain to a child where the difference lies in useing/having a discreat space, eucleadian space and manilfod. Give real world examples in data science where one would encounter these three examples .
Gradient Descent on Euclidean Space applies when dealing with linear data and functions, where the standard rules of algebra, geometry, and calculus work. It is used in data science for linear regression when trying to determine the best weights for feature variables. Gradient Descent on a Riemannian Manifold is used when dealing with non-linear functions where traditional calculus does not work or when dealing with high-dimensional spaces. It is used in data science when dealing with non-linear models such as support vector machines, neural networks, and clustering algorithms.

To explain the difference to a child, you can use a common example like driving a car. In a discrete space like a parking lot, there would be a finite number of spots with discrete boundaries, so you know exactly where you have to make a turn if you want to find a spot to park. In a Euclidean space like a street, you can move around much more freely because the boundaries aren't as apparent. When maneuvering around a Riemannian Manifold, like a mountain terrain, you would have to take into account unfamiliar terrain, its shape and its properties, as you would need to adjust your movements to avoid obstacles, sync your body motion to the terrain, and adapt to the constantly changing landscape.

In data science, one would encounter these three examples when dealing with supervised or unsupervised learning problems. For example, in a classification problem with discrete data, discrete space would apply for feature variables which are mutually exclusive, like gender or color. In a regression problem with continuous data, Euclidean space would be used for linear regression models. And in a clustering problem with high dimensional data, Riemannian Manifold would be used to create non-linear models and find patterns in the data.
